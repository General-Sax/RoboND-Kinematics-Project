That context was using SymPy in Jupyter notebooks, where I could leverage the power of the notebooks' cell-based execution to streamline exploratory work. \n",

    "As I started implementing a solution, I found that I didn't like the suggested organization of the handle_calculate_IK function. It struck me as inelegant to be programmatically constructing and manipulating invariant constructs solution inside the working server code. and as such, I sought to  as many features underlying problem structure as possible. much of the process of deriving the components of a working solution was  to distill the inverse kinematics problem down to its essence, and do my best to refine the IK_server loop into a representation of a solution to that problem.\n",
